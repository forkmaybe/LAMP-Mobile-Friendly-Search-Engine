After database has been updated with new table and columns in db prep folder

We have to run some manual commands for now:

*set all companies as Employer in jobs table

UPDATE  `recruiter` SET  `recruiter_type` =  "Employer"

*set all jobs as Employer in jobs table

UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Employer"

*set Stelfox as an Agency, if there is any other companies already there thats an Agency then put there id in this and repeat

UPDATE  `recruiter` SET  `recruiter_type` =  "Agency" WHERE `recruiter_id` = 385

*set all Stelfox jobs as Agency in jobs table

UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Agency" WHERE `recruiter_id` = 385

*any new agencies can be set as Agency with the new textbox in recruiter registration
*but after there jobs have been added to jobs table you must run this query

*set all of that agencies jobs as Agency in jobs table

UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Agency" WHERE `recruiter_id` = <insert new agency recruiter id>

For now you must run these queries after any jobs are added to the database:

first set all jobs as Employer, then keep the queries saved for any agencies and these run in this order:

UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Employer";
UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Agency" WHERE `recruiter_id` = 385
UPDATE  `jobs` SET  `job_recruiter_type` =  "Agency" WHERE `recruiter_id` = <insert new agency recruiter id>
